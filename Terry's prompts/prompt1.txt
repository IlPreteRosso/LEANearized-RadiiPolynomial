I am experimenting with ways to use computer assistance to help convert informal mathematical proofs into formal Lean proofs. 

In the attachments, I provide another informally written proof of the same implication. I would like you to generate a Lean file that tries to formalize this proof into Lean to the extent that you are able to, in a format similar to that in the third attachment. Thus, the output should be a Lean file with comments drawn from the informal proof, and each comment followed by a suitable translation into Lean. If you are uncertain as to how to formalize a given step, do the best u can, and add "sorry" to any step that you were unable to formalize; I will then manually try to fill any sorries and fix any other issues.
