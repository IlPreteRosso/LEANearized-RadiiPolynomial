I am experimenting with ways to use computer assistance to help convert informal mathematical proofs into formal Lean proofs. 

In the attachments, I provide an informally written proof of the same implication. 

I would like you to generate a Lean file that tries to formalize this proof into Lean to the extent that you are able to. Thus, the output should be a Lean file with comments drawn from the informal proof, and each comment followed by a suitable translation into Lean. If you are uncertain as to how to formalize a given step, do the best u can, and add "sorry" to any step that you were unable to formalize; I will then manually try to fill any sorries and fix any other issues.

The explicit norms or computational techniques are not important. Keep the proof in an abstract sense (for instance, L1, L2 or L infinity norms are not important, just use the fact that we have norm axioms and the metric space is complete, i.e. an abstract Banach space. Be aware that the codebase for the contraction mapping theorem uses extended reals, extended norms and extended metric space. In our informal proof we assume standard reals, norms and metric space. You need to find a way to work this around.
