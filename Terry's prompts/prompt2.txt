I am experimenting with ways to use computer assistance to help convert informal mathematical proofs into formal Lean proofs. 



In the attachment I provide you with the informal proof. I would like you to generate a Lean file that tries to formalize this proof into Lean to the extent that you are able to. Thus, the output should be a Lean file with comments drawn from the informal proof, and each comment followed by a suitable translation into Lean. If you are uncertain as to how to formalize a given step, do the best u can, and add "sorry" to any step that you were unable to formalize; I will then manually try to fill any sorries and fix any other issues.



Lean (version 4.24.0-rc1, arm64-apple-darwin23.6.0, commit 919e297292280cdb27598edd4e03437be5850221, Release)

Lake version 5.0.0-src+919e297 (Lean version 4.24.0-rc1)



The explicit norms or computational techniques are not important. Keep the proof in an abstract sense (for instance, L1, L2 or L infinity norms are not important, just use the fact that we have norm axioms and the metric space is complete, i.e. an abstract Banach space. 



Be aware that the codebase for the contraction mapping theorem uses extended reals, extended norms and extended metric space. In our informal proof we assume standard reals, norms and metric space. You need to find a way to work this around.





So far I've gotten these

NEUMANN SERIES THEOREM FOR INVERTIBILITY
================================================================================

This section proves that operators close to the identity are invertible,
with the inverse given by the Neumann series.

We break the proof into manageable lemmas, each handling one aspect.

Note: We assume `[Nontrivial E]` throughout this section since we're working
with operators on meaningful Banach spaces where Newton's method makes sense.
In practice, spaces like ℝⁿ (n ≥ 1), function spaces, etc. are all nontrivial.

Alternative formulation: p(r) = (Z(r) - 1)r + Y₀.

# MAIN RADII POLYNOMIAL THEOREM (Theorem 2.4.2)
================================================================================

This is the main result that guarantees existence of a unique nondegenerate zero.

/--
Main radii polynomial theorem for proving existence of nondegenerate zeros.
If the radii polynomial has a negative value at some r₀ > 0, then there exists
a unique zero x̃ in the ball B_r₀(x̄), and this zero is nondegenerate.

# CONVERGENCE TO NEWTON'S METHOD
================================================================================

From Section 2.5 (mentioned in the user's request):
If x̃ is a zero, Df(x̃) is invertible, x̄ is sufficiently close to x̃,
and we have sufficient computational resources, then the radii polynomial
approach guarantees finding x̃.
-/

/--
If the initial guess is sufficiently close to a nondegenerate zero,
then the radii polynomial approach succeeds.

The better way to use tactics is to state the change of the symbols (equations of the proposition, if the proposition is defined in this way) with the `calc` tactic and then followed by the tactics that are used to carry out the pattern matching. If there are no equations to rewrite (say the proposition is defined by logical predication or other statements) then make sure you comment the steps and formulas on top of each use of tactics. More readable steps are always welcome.

Now I'm working on finite_telescoping
