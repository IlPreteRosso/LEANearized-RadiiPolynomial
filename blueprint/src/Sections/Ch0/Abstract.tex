This blueprint presents a formalization in Lean 4 of the radii polynomial approach 
for proving existence of zeros of nonlinear functions on Banach spaces. The method 
combines the contraction mapping theorem with Newton-like operators, enabling 
computer-assisted proofs of existence and uniqueness of solutions.

The formalization covers both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings, 
with particular emphasis on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Banach Fixed Point Theorem (Contraction Mapping Theorem)
  \item Newton-like operators for zero-finding problems
  \item Radii polynomial approach in finite dimensions (Theorem 2.4.2)
  \item General radii polynomial approach on Banach spaces (Theorem 7.6.2)
  \item Neumann series for operator invertibility
\end{itemize}

The formalization extends classical results to maps between potentially different 
Banach spaces $E$ and $F$, requiring careful treatment of approximate inverses 
and approximate derivatives.
