# LEANearized Radii Polynomial — Blueprint (Lean + `leanblueprint`)

This repository contains a **Lean blueprint** for the
**Radii polynomials in finite dimensions**.

> Proof flow at a glance:  
> data → Newton map \(T = x - A f(x)\) → a‑priori bounds \((Y_0, Z_0, Z_2)\) → radii polynomial \(p(r)\) → derivative bound → fixed‑point radii lemma → main theorem (existence, uniqueness, nondegeneracy).
